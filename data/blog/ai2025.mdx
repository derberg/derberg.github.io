## Prompt-Integrated Marketing

We’re relying on GenAI more and more every day. The faster we get, the less time we spend researching or double-checking the accuracy of its answers. Part of the reason is that the models are improving—they make fewer mistakes, so we instinctively trust them more. At least, that’s what I’ve noticed in my own experience.

What about you? For me, the difference between ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4o is massive. And it’s only going to get better.

Now, tools like [bolt.new](bolt.new) and [lovable.dev](lovable.dev) are speeding things up even further, especially when it comes to app creation. They don’t just spit out ideas—they generate entire projects. And they come with opinions built-in, deciding for you what tech stack to use. [Lovable.dev](lovable.dev) won’t let you use Astro, while Bolt defaults to it.

Here’s where it gets interesting: as trust in GenAI grows, it’s becoming a tempting channel for companies to promote their solutions. But will we, as users, even notice when we’re getting served promotional content? Will existing regulations for search engines cover these AI tools, or will companies find ways around them?

I trully hope 2025 sparks more conversations about this. If I were handling marketing for a big company with a solid budget, I know what I’d do—I’d cut a deal with tools like [bolt.new](bolt.new) or [lovable.dev](lovable.dev) to push my solutions ahead of the competition.

What’s your take? Are we ready for this shift in marketing? Or is it already happening under our noses?

## Raise of CLIs for Developer Portals

It’s all about speed.

- "yo, gimme code for that" - copy/paste, done with speed.

- "yo, gimme curl for that API call" - copy/paste, done with speed.

- "yo, gimme that yaml" - copy/paste, done with speed.

- "yo, how to get a dev app in Facebook" - no speed, no copy/paste. You’re stuck clicking through menus, hoping the instructions match the current UI.

The magic of GenAI is its ability to deliver speed. If the answer slows me down, my brain checks out—I just want to copy/paste and move on.

For "yo, how to get a dev app in Facebook," the ideal answer should be: copy/paste a Facebook CLI command, done.

If you’re running a Developer Portal and forcing users to click around endlessly, you’re already lagging. It’s time to catch up. If you haven’t yet, make building a CLI one of your goals for 2025.

Slack has a CLI. Backstage has one. Vercel and Netlify do, too. The trend is clear.

Get a CLI, or get left behind.

## No-Code AI Dev Tools

So far, I’ve seen a lot of tools that speed up the work of developers. Maybe I mentioned earlier that I just copy/paste and don’t think much—but I can do that because of my experience. I know where to copy/paste, how to prompt AI, and the right vocabulary to use. These tools are not built for people without a development background.

Developers aren’t at risk.

But in 2025, we’ll start seeing development tools that embrace no-code principles. Users won’t see any code. Instead, they’ll just enter a prompt, and the app will be running, deployed, and adjusting in real-time based on follow-up prompts. It’s still early—no massive products yet—but it’s a start that could disrupt the market and leave some developers feeling uneasy.

Don’t worry, though—senior developers will always be in demand. As for the junior devs? They’re flexible, they’ll adapt, and they’ll find a way to adjust to the changes.
