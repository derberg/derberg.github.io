In 2022, I dreamed about the "APIs Summit"â€”a community-driven conference to discuss APIs, network, and hold open conversations without businesses looking over our shoulders. Trying to drive the idea through official channels of various standards felt like a burnout-inducing nightmare. I gave up after a few meetings.

Fortunately, [apidays](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apidays-conferences/) and [Mehdi Medjaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdimedjaoui/) stepped in, offering us a vendor-neutral booth free of charge.

Of course, I had my doubts: This is a commercial event; should we really do it? But my philosophy has always been, Try it and see. You donâ€™t have to continue if it doesnâ€™t work.

The booth offer was for the [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7272545411062472704/), but to me, it felt natural to say: _Yes, but not for AsyncAPI aloneâ€”we need a shared community booth._

We had our first "API Specs and Standards" booth at APIDays Paris in 2023. Fast forward to December 2024, and weâ€™ve organized the booth four timesâ€”and I love that we did.

"API Standards" (is that the final name?) is growing. Can I already call it a community? Iâ€™m not sureâ€”you tell me. What I can say is that itâ€™s a group of friends from different standards, companies, or even freelancers. What connects them is a shared passion for open-source, community, and APIs. They work at the booth during events, cover for each other when someone needs a break, and offer supportâ€”even if their companies have their own vendor booths. Itâ€™s a small pack of amazing people. Honestly, if thatâ€™s not a definition of community, then I donâ€™t know what is. ðŸ˜ƒ

So, what about the "APIs Summit"? Iâ€™m no longer sure a dedicated conference is necessary. At the booth, Iâ€™ve already had so many valuable discussionsâ€”not just with conference attendees but also with other booth staff from communities like [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-api-initiative/), [JSON Schema](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jsonschema/), or [GraphQL Foundation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/graphql-foundation/). Why create a new conference when APIs are well-established, and there are already many great API conferences out there? Wouldnâ€™t it make more sense to focus on strengthening the "API Standards" community? Maybe even secure some funding to expand and represent this unique, vendor-neutral group at more events?

"APIs Summit" was never about profit or generating revenue. The goal for me was always community. You canâ€™t build a community while prioritizing money.

So, is it wrong to merge a non-profit idea with a commercial conference? As an open-source fanatic and advocate for community-driven projects and open governance, I donâ€™t think so. To me, itâ€™s a perfect example of symbiosis. Conference organizers provide "API Standards" with free space at events, access to new communities, networking opportunities, and free tickets. In return, they get a great marketing assetâ€”experts at the event who are accessible, knowledgeable, and supportive.

Whatâ€™s missing from this setup? Panel discussions? I doubt thatâ€™s an issue. If the "API Standards" folks wanted to host a panel, Iâ€™m sure it would be easy to arrange with conference hosts.

I still think about the "APIs Summit," but now I imagine it as a small, non-profit, intimate gathering of 50â€“100 people within the "API Standards" communityâ€”perhaps an unconference format. Maybe in 2026?

Lol, this was supposed to be a short message shared in the morning, but it turned into an article.

What do you think? What should we do in 2025?

Folks, there is no opt-out :)
