Read below article, as ChatGPT will give you a very misleading answer with links poining to not
existing resources - as usual.

We live in times where people seem tired of cloud tools, not only for privacy reasons. In recent years, there‚Äôs been a big push towards online IDEs, code spaces, and other flashy solutions. But we all know how the web works. You start with a simple online tool, like a basic REST client, and before you know it, it‚Äôs a bloated app loaded with features you‚Äôll never use, and it takes forever to load.

To move fast, you need local and minimal setups. In this article, I‚Äôll explore tools that help you work with AsyncAPI documents with just the basics.

> In this article intentionally I ignore existance of AsyncAPI documents created with JSON. Editing huge JSON files manually is a nightmare. My assumption is that if someone stores an AsyncAPI document with JSON, it is most probably generated from code, and therefore below article is not interesting for such users.

## Plain IDE

You don‚Äôt need much more than your favorite IDE.

> If your favorite IDE isn‚Äôt [on this list](https://www.schemastore.org/json/#editors), it might be time to consider a better one.

With just your IDE, you can get awesome features like:

#### Validation

Instant feedback on whether your document is valid.

  height={220}
/>

#### Tooltips

[Ace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acebuild/) has worked hard to ensure the descriptions in the AsyncAPI spec markdown are reflected in JSON Schema tooltips. This means you‚Äôll see detailed descriptions like this:

/>

#### Autocompletion

But how does it work?

AsyncAPI is essentially [a markdown document](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/blob/master/spec/asyncapi.md) that defines all rules, fields, and vocabularies. Cool, but it‚Äôs massive! AsyncAPI documents can represent complex structures. How do you ensure your document is valid? Use [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

At AsyncAPI, we provide [JSON Schemas](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec-json-schemas/) that define validation rules described initially in specification markdown file. These schemas integrate with [SchemaStore](https://www.schemastore.org/) ‚Äî a fantastic open-source project.

### SchemaStore

SchemaStore is a community-driven project that hosts JSON Schemas for many tools and frameworks (GitHub Actions, OpenAPI, Angular, ESLint, etc.). IDEs use SchemaStore‚Äôs API to enable features like validation and autocompletion.

SchemaStore also holds information on how to match schemas to files based on given patterns, making it even easier to use.

### File Naming

AsyncAPI doesn‚Äôt enforce naming conventions for documents. However, we recommend the following pattern:

```
"fileMatch": ["asyncapi.json", "asyncapi.yml", "asyncapi.yaml"]
```

This means your file name should include `asyncapi` (lowercase):

- `asyncapi-client.yml`
- `websocket_asyncapi.yaml`

### (Optional) YAML Extension

If you use VSCode, install the [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) for SchemaStore support with YAML files. IntelliJ IDEA users‚Äîyou‚Äôre in luck; it‚Äôs built-in.

<Image
  alt="SchemaStore example"
  src="/static/images/asyncapi-local/schemastore1.png"
  width={1078}
  height={192}
/>

When your IDE recognizes the file as AsyncAPI, you‚Äôre set.

### Summary

By simply naming your files correctly and installing an extension when needed, you get great features:

‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Easy to set up, you just need to name your files properly.
- No dependencies.
- Validation!
- Autocompletion and detailed descriptions.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons:**

- Limited validation (JSON Schema covers ~80% of cases). Not all rules can be described with JSON Schema.
- No human-readable preview unless you count YAML as human format üòä.

## IDE Plugins and Extensions

Want more power? Add plugins or extensions to your IDE. I still recommend you stick to the [naming convention](#file-naming) for AsyncAPI documents.

### VSCode

The [`asyncapi-preview`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asyncapi.asyncapi-preview) extension offers features like:

- Scaffold an example AsyncAPI document.
- Render documentation for humans.
- Visualize application communication (EDA visualizer).

> Check out the [extension‚Äôs source code](https://github.com/asyncapi/vs-asyncapi-preview), its integrated [docs view](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react), and the [visualizer](https://github.com/asyncapi/EDAVisualiser).

### IntelliJ

There‚Äôs also a plugin for IntelliJ called...surprise surprise: [AsyncAPI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15673-asyncapi). It offers:

- Scaffold an example AsyncAPI document.
- Resolve references with autocompletion üòç
- Render previews in a browser.

> Check out the [plugin‚Äôs source code](https://github.com/asyncapi/jasyncapi-idea-plugin).

### Summary

No real downsides here!

‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Human-readable previews
- Community-driven: contribute if needed
- Detailed validation (beyond JSON Schema). These tools use official AsyncAPI component for docs rendering, with official AsyncAPI Parser included for validation purposes.

## AsyncAPI CLI

Let‚Äôs level up with [AsyncAPI CLI](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tools/cli/installation). Whether you use it alone or with an IDE, it‚Äôs packed with features:

- **Detailed validation**:

  ```bash
  asyncapi validate ./asyncapi-client.yaml

  Errors:
  39:9  error  asyncapi3-operation-messages-from-referred-channel  Operation message does not belong to the specified channel.  operations.sendUserSignedup.messages[0]
  ```

- **Run AsyncAPI Studio locally with hot reload**:

  ```bash
  asyncapi start studio -f ./asyncapi-client.yaml
  ```

- **Scaffold an example document**:

  ```bash
  asyncapi new --file-name=my-asyncapi.yml --example=default-example.yaml --no-tty
  ```

And [much more](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tools/cli/usage), like code generation, bundling, and conversion.

### Summary

AsyncAPI CLI is fantastic. CLIs are underrated tools every developer should use.

‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Works without an IDE
- Comprehensive validation and features
- Integrated Studio for previews

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons:**

- Studio (preview tool) is still a web app and lacks local file system references support.

> Pro Tip: Contribute to [the project](https://github.com/asyncapi/cli/issues/1627) to solve the limitation.

## My Choice

I'm a VSCode user so:

- I follow AsyncAPI recommended [naming convention](#file-naming) for AsyncAPI documents and use YAML extension.
- The [asyncapi-preview](#vscode) extension and the EDA visualizer üòç
- For all the extra feature, I always have a dedicated terminal window to run [AsyncAPI CLI](#asyncapi-cli) commands.

Stay local, stay free.
