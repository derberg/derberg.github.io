    description:
      "I've seen it all. At SAP, I navigated the complexities of open-sourcing projects before the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) was established—working through countless meetings with legal, security, and executives. Later, as an OSPO champion at SAP, I contributed to its growth and mission. At Postman, I transitioned into a full-time role as an open source maintainer and community builder, gaining valuable insights into both fostering open source initiatives internally and collaborating with OSPOs externally. With my deep understanding of how open source works—both internally and externally—I'm here to make your open source journey seamless and impactful.",

Since 2020, I've served as a full-time maintainer, and later as the Executive Director of the AsyncAPI Initiative. I'm deeply engaged with the community—attending conferences, conducting research on how companies use AsyncAPI in production, and driving its evolution. My journey with AsyncAPI has given me unique insights and expertise that I'm excited to share with you. Whether you need help adopting AsyncAPI in your organization, migrating from v2 to v3, navigating tooling, or tackling other challenges, I'm here to guide you every step of the way.",
