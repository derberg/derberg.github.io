## Origin aka Boring Story

My first interaction with open-source happened back in 2014, and I was immediately captivated by the concept. The idea of people collaborating openly, across borders, with a shared goal of creating something better fascinated me. At the time, I didn’t contribute much code, largely due to imposter syndrome, which was in full swing. Yet, even then, I sensed that contributing to open-source wasn’t just about writing code. People can give back in so many other ways.

So, I found my own path, helping by securing funding for one of the projects and [promoting tools at conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-1goNbdBkc&t=1652s).

Everyone needs a role model—someone to inspire or spark that first sense of purpose. For me, that person was [Benjamin Lupton](https://github.com/balupton). We were using [DocPad](https://docpad.bevry.me/), and after watching [Ben's DocPad presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu1uhI0uT2o), I knew I was slowly becoming an open-source enthusiast, or maybe even a fanatic.

## Now

Today, I work full-time on open-source projects, focusing on community-driven initiatives. This adventure began in February 2020, and I’ve never looked back. My primary focus is on the [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/), where I serve as a maintainer, a member of the Technical Steering Committee, and the Executive Director.

In addition to my technical work, I’m passionate about educating people on the value of open-source—teaching companies how they can get involved and why investing in open-source is a crucial decision for their future success.

## For Hire

### AsyncAPI Expert

I have hands-on experience with AsyncAPI, having previously used it as a product owner responsible for building an Event Catalog. For the past four years, I’ve been one of the maintainers of the AsyncAPI specification and have contributed to several AsyncAPI-related tools. My primary focus is code generation, where I play a key role in advancing the development of the [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator), which has become the most popular AsyncAPI tool based on GitHub stars.

I possess an in-depth understanding of the AsyncAPI specification, organizational processes, and the entire tooling ecosystem. I can provide expert consulting services, offering valuable insights and guidance for projects using AsyncAPI.

### Open Source Expert

I’ve been actively involved in open source for over a decade, with more than four years as a full-time maintainer. I’ve had the unique experience of driving open-source-focused development within a corporate environment, collaborating closely with internal OSPOs as an open-source ambassador. This has involved pushing boundaries, educating teams, and ensuring the organization was fully immersed in the open-source culture.

On the flip side, I’ve also worked with external companies, understanding their needs and helping them to support open-source in meaningful ways. I can assist your company in establishing a strong open-source culture, helping you understand how open-source works, and showing why it’s a worthwhile investment for long-term success.

I have experience with:

- building and scaling open-source communities
- organizing online conferences and in-person events
- securing sponsorships for open-source projects
- working within open governance communities

The only thing I'm not good at is selling myself.
