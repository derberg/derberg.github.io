    description:
      "I've seen things. I worked at SAP when there was yet no OSPO team, and getting a project open-sourced was a long way of endless meetings with legal, security, and executives. Then, I was actively involved as the OSPO champion promoting open source inside the company. Later, I joined the open-source community full-time, cooperating with companies and their OSPOs. I can help you with the creation of your OSPO, with the promotion of open source inside your company. The best companies are the ones with open source culture at their core.",
