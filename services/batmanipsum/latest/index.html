So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you&#39;ve truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra&#39;s Al Ghul&#39;s destiny. We will destroy Gotham.

That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin&#39;s, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It&#39;s an orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don&#39;t remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can&#39;t do, move on. After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy&#39;s home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror. It&#39;s like putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that&#39;s all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I&#39;d seen that look on your face before. It&#39;s the same one I taught myself. I don&#39;t why you took the fault for Dent&#39;s murder but I&#39;m still a believer in the Batman. Even if you&#39;re not...</p><p>Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion. Eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering. Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.

They can&#39;t be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.</p><p>Ra&#39;s Al Ghul: Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear.

You do like to play things pretty close to the chest.</p><p>Bane: Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it.
